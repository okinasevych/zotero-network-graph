zotero-network-graph
====================

Network-style visualization for Zotero collections.

The Zotero features that have influenced the current idea include:

- the Timelines feature for visualizing Zotero items over time, and
- the Related window that allows one to arbitrarily map individual Zotero items to other Zotero items.

Outside Zotero, the D3.js library appears to be a prime candidate for creating visualizations from Zotero data. Specifically, I would like to see visualizations of the relationships of Related items in my various Zotero collections.
